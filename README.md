In connection with the expansion, the IT company needs to create a RESTfull web service for internal management of the company. The teams consist of managers and programmers of different levels (Jun/Mid/Senior) and types (developer, QA, DevOps). All of them can work on several projects at the same time. A relational database must be used for data storage.
Implemented APIs for CRUD operations for employees and projects.
Implemented by @ExceptionHandler.
